> `ls` on dir -> read == list  dir contents, exec == "search" ie allow access to files in dir (then check file perms)  
> `argv[0]` -> name of program  
> `argc`/`argv` -> command line arguments giving to program (think python input)  
> `/dev/fd/0` == `/dev/stdin`; better than using hyphen for input  
> `ldd <program> | grep libc`  
> `make` -> A Database System using time stamps; expects time to always be increasing  
> `adjtime` -> preferred call for adjusting linux time  
> `lc_*` for locales regarding time, money, chars, numerics
