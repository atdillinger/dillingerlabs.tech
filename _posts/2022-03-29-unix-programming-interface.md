> `ls` on dir -> read == list  dir contents, exec == "search" ie allow access to files in dir (then check file perms)
> `argv[0]` -> name of program
> `argc`/`argv` -> command line arguments giving to program (think python input)
> `/dev/fd/0` == `/dev/stdin`; better than using hyphen for input
> `ldd <program> | grep libc`
