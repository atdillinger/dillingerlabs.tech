# Focuses
## Expand my Fall Zone
  - I should "just keep going" on gym 5.11
    - Example: At Climb Iowa - after the 4th clip I should not take or say "watch me"
  - I need to increase my fall experience (project more in the 5.10+ range where falls should happen)

## Chapter One
- Set an intention for the climb
    - get to x point and what happens after is free
- Find littles ways to engage in the current

## Chapter Two
- Move to Stance, Think, Move to Next Stance
- Stress is Normal and Desirable in Philosophy and Practice
- "difficult" means stress; watch for saying difficult

## Chapter Three
- Focus on "process goals" - In the moment say to self "next move is valuable, so make it" Ie if you get the position and the risk is acceptable the move should be made

# Chapter Four
- Improve Belaying: if the draws move then add more slack
- Change of partners; I can increase slack
- Don't watch climber for fall; feel it an react
- At stances BERP (Breadth, Relaxed Eyes; relaxed Body; Posture)
- Convert my intellectual knowledge to experiential knowledge

# Chapter Five
- "Stop and Think" or "Move and Do" Mindset
- Technique: Lower Heel?? Review myself, am I on my toes to much?
- Technique: "little Feet" - Less big moves using legs/arms; Review myself; Think I do this pretty well
- Practice Down Climb on Lead; Use this to climb smarter
- Learning stops once you fall or take; Push on
- Am I unattached from the end goal or am I wrapped up in the mind gaming of think I am no attached but I am
    - ie: Royal Flush attempt; i believe I failed because of the vibration but was it that I knew the goal was difficult and I did feel comfortable?
    - I believe the situation was too far beyond my comfort zone (for achieving success; too much pressure, lack of sleep, poor condies, imbalance)

# Practice
- Discuss takes with partners; have them say "one more hold" if we know that the fall zones are yes, else take
- Can I hold Warrior 2 for 3 to 5 (think this is good mental practice for mediating under stress
- Stay climbing engaged and then fall
- Need a route that is 60 feet so that practices can happen at 40 feet
- Practice Pendulum Lead Falls (something that scares me)
- Practice Ledge Falls (something that scares me)
- Practice Full stack falls (at 40ft), do top rope, do lead falls
- Practice Falls with self, don't tell belayer to build confidence and skills, by falling at bolt and progress by 1 hold each hold
- Practice Falls with belayer initialed falls
- Resting -> Transitioning -> Climbing; Say that out loud
- Lower heels to de-stress
