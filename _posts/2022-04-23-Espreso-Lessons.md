# Focuses
## Expand my Fall Zone
  - I should "just keep going" on gym 5.11
    - Example: At Climb Iowa - after the 4th clip I should not take or say "watch me"
  - I need to increase my fall experience (project more in the 5.10+ range where falls should happen)

## Chapter One
- Set an intention for the climb
    - get to x point and what happens after is free
- Find littles ways to engage in the current

## Chapter Two
- Move to Stance, Think, Move to Next Stance
- Stress is Normal and Desirable in Philosophy and Practice
- "difficult" means stress; watch for saying difficult

## Chapter Three
- Focus on "process goals" - In the moment say to self "next move is valuable, so make it" Ie if you get the position and the risk is acceptable the move should be made

# Chapter Four
- Improve Belaying: if the draws move then add more slack
- Change of partners; I can increase slack
- Don't watch climber for fall; feel it an react
- At stances BERP (Breadth, Relaxed Eyes; relaxed Body; Posture)
