> The Radical View:
> Computer programs have become too large and compelx to encompass in a human mind. Therefore, the job of computer scieve education is to teach people how to expand their minds so that the programs can fit, by learning to think in a vocabulary of larger, more powerful, more flexible ideas than the obvious ones. Each unit of programming though must have a big payoff in the capabilities of the program.

# What is this domain for?
The idea for `dillingerlabs` came from a conference talk by [Kelsey Hightower](TODO). He was showing his K8s work and pulled up his personal site. I idea of a "lab" to experiment and learn about computers inticed me. I attribute my emboldended interest with computers to him. That desires another post in its own right. 

I went home that night and what searching for a domain that would continue to inspire me, be professional, and cheap. But once I purchases the domain, I got sidelined on other projects at work and changing roling and it sat doriment for the longest time. For two reasons; At that time I was working with server management and put most of my focus on non-website material like Python, Ansible, Docker and k8s. I did not feel comfortable to share my work. Which I now regret.
