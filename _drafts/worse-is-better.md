# Worse is Better
A few peers and I were talking recently and one of the them mentioned the _worse is better_ philosophy. I had never heard of it and asked for a [link](https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html). 
Again, as with most technical philosophy, what I was expected to walk in on was not what I ran across. In that way I love this hobby, there are always more layers to this onion.

After letting the words, funnel through my sleeping mind (there is a no a post there); I realized this is a philosophy that I use every day when coding. In my head I has always seen my focus on implementation as a by-product of valuing my fellow humans as they follow along my development journey but I think this article provides another perspective.

While I agree with the article, I think a strong case for its value is that of the fellow man. Code that focus on interface will also be short of devliver. I have never found any two huamns that are truly alike, though genetical yes. So by prioritizing these perfect interface you are destined to fail to deliver and even more become dishearted in the work. If on the other hand one focuses on the human aspect (the implementation) then the solution tends to flow from the fingertips. If the implementation is easy the sleeping mind solves the puzzle, when the implementaiton is complicated the hubris is needed to solve the problem and hubris is what will doom us all.
