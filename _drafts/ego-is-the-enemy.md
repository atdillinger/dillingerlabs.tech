# Ego

# Never give reasons for what you think or do until you must. Maybe.
# Talking depletes us
# They don't talk much or mind the feeling that others are enjoying the limelight \*
# Does this help me do what I set out to do
# Ego rushes to the end
# Leave passion to amateurs. Make it about what you feel you must do and say. Not what you care about and wish to be.
# Replace passions with purpose
I want to focus on this wording. What I have for technology is  purpose not a passion. Create an arrow to manifesting
# Passion typically masks a weakness
    What does this mean to me? What am I truly passionate about?
# Opportunities are obscure, dusted over, blocked by various forms of resistance
# Restrain Yourself
In regards to ego, what does that feel like to me? I think this chapter had the least impacts to me
# Let others take your credit... I'm here for the long game - find my silenece dogood
# What do I have pride about?
Do I face with climbing? Am I prideful about my ability to climbing better than my peers?
# Don't boast. There's nothing in it for you
# In regards to 10,000 hours - To think of a number is to live in a conditional future... To put it more bluntly "We are simply talking about a lot of hours
# Ignore others and your own accolades
#Here we are having accomplished something. After we give ourselves credit, ego wants us to think, I'm special, I'm better, The rules don't apply to me.
# That uncomfortable feeling. that defensiveness that you feel when your most deeply held assumptions are challenged - what about subjecting yourself to it deliberately? change you mind, change your surroundings.
# When we are aspiring we must resist the impulse to reverse engineer success from other people's stories. When we achieve our own, we must resist the desire to pretend that everything unfolded exactly as we'd planned. There was no grand narrative. You should remember-you were there when it happened.
#Narrative is when you look back at an improbable or unlikely path to your success and say: I knew it all along. Instead of: I hoped. I worked. I got some good breaks. Or even: I thought this could happen. Of course you didn't really know all along-or if you did, it was more faith than knowledge. But who wants to remember all the times you doubted yourself?
# you start with a small bet and itera tively scale your ambitions as you go. His other famous piece of advice, "Keep your identity small," fits well here. Make it about the work and the principles behind it
