# Ego

# Never give reasons for what you think or do until you must. Maybe.
# Talking depletes us
# They don't talk much or mind the feeling that others are enjoying the limelight \*
# Does this help me do what I set out to do
# Ego rushes to the end
# Leave passion to amateurs. Make it about what you feel you must do and say. Not what you care about and wish to be.
# Replace passions with purpose
I want to focus on this wording. What I have for technology is  purpose not a passion. Create an arrow to manifesting
# Passion typically masks a weakness
    What does this mean to me? What am I truly passionate about?
# Opportunities are obscure, dusted over, blocked by various forms of resistance
