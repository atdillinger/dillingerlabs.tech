listcomps: list only (duh); learn how to intergrate into variable assignment - brackets
genexp: haven't really used this but they work for things other than lists (str, tuple) - parathesis
tuple unpacking: this is how multiple function assignment works. Use this for record management to reduce overhead
NamedTuples: use this for improved record management, potential more powerful than dict as space is assigned to class versus each dict object
Deafultdict
setdefault(kev, []) for example to set value to empty list; use in loops to avoid extra code
Collections.counter() 
Userdict
